    <h1>The Best Movies According to Aditya</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Scarface</h3>
    <p>There's too much expertise, too much sheer love of movie-making up there on the screen for Scarface to be deemed a failure. But the director's failure to follow through makes this a too-long movie that comes up short.</p>
    <h3>The Godfather</h3>
    <p>It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.</p>
    <h3>Rambo: Last Blood</h3>
    <p>Rambo: Last Blood is a film that continues the series' track record of ultra-violence, shallow characterization, and irresponsible politics. It combines elements from movies like Taken and Home Alone, with an elderly war hero at the forefront and intense violence.</p>
